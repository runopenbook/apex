"""Midday fills. From a cutoff date forward, trades change hands in the
12:00-1:30pm ET window (the mean of the 12:00/12:30/13:00 30-min bars) instead of
the daily close. Older trades keep the close. The daily NAV curve still marks at
the close — only the *trade* price moves to midday.

Yahoo serves ~2 months of 30-min data, which is plenty: the cutoff is "now", so
only going-forward trades are ever repriced, and those days are always recent.
