"""Intraday equity curve at 30-minute resolution.

The daily snapshots are the official record, but they make the chart one coarse
line per day. This values the book at 30-min intervals (reconstructing the
holdings the portfolio *entered* each day with, since trades execute at the close)
so the dashboard shows real within-day movement, like a brokerage app.

Built once per daily run and merged into state.json as `intraday`. Network call
is wrapped so a failure never breaks the daily update.
