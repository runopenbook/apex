"""Slipstream — momentum ETF rotation, run forward in public.

A medium-risk book that rotates through whatever global ETFs are running hot,
and bails the moment the move tires. Two sleeves:

  • Core anchors (~35%): broad international funds, held as ballast.
  • Rotation (~65%): the hottest names on a broad universe of country, region
    and sector ETFs, ranked by trailing 1-month + 3-month trend.

Each rotation position lives or dies by four "doors", measured from its entry:
  • −8%  → stop out (the loser door).
  • +13% → it's "armed". After that: slip back below +13% and it's sold (lock
    the gain); push past +21% and it's sold (target); or sit in the +13–21%
    hallway for two weeks without resolving and it's sold (stalled).
A sold name then sits out a ~1-month cooldown; a fresh name is held a minimum
1 week before profit-doors can fire (so the book doesn't churn intraweek).

UNIVERSE — built mechanically, NOT hand-picked: a wide net is cast by whole ETF
families (the full single-country lineup incl. the obscure ones, all SPDR
sectors + a broad industry/thematic net, the standard regions, broad intl funds
for the core), then pruned by a rule only — must have 3-month history by the
seed and clear a liquidity floor measured at inception. No ticker gets special
treatment; the survivor list is frozen at the seed so the book's menu is stable.

HONESTY: simulated as if started ~1 month ago. Every pick — at the seed and at
every rotation — is ranked using ONLY data available on that date. NAV is price
return; dividends are tracked apart.
